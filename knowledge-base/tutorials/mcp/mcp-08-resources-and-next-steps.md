# MCP Tutorial — Chapter 8: Resources & Next Steps

## Further reading

- MCP design docs (project-specific links) — (replace with your project's registry/docs links).
- Reproducible builds and dependency pinning guides.
- Papers and blog posts about model packaging and reproducibility.

## Practical next steps

1. Pick an internal model or module and write an `mcp.yaml` for it.
2. Add CI checks to validate the MCP artifact and run tests on PRs.
3. Publish the artifact to your internal registry and try running it from another machine.

## Suggestions for expanding this tutorial

- Add a video walkthrough showing how to package and run an artifact.
- Add diagrams for the execution flow and recommended folder layouts.
- Provide a downloadable example repository that contains full examples and a simple registry mock.
