# MCP Tutorial — Chapter 1: Introduction

## What this chapter covers

- High-level overview of MCP (Model/Module/Minimum Compatible Protocol — adjust to your project's MCP meaning).
- Why MCP matters: reproducibility, portability, clarity of contracts.
- Target audience and learning objectives.

## Learning objectives

After this chapter you will be able to:

- Describe the core purpose of MCP and its place in a typical ML/data engineering workflow.
- List typical components that make up an MCP-style specification (model, metadata, runtime expectations).

## Who is this for

This tutorial series is for engineers, researchers, and learners who want a practical guide to MCP-style artifacts, their structure, how bytecode/execution works, and common tooling.

## Quick overview

An MCP-style approach focuses on clearly specifying a component (model or module), its inputs/outputs, and how to run it so others — or automated systems — can reproduce results. We'll cover both conceptual and hands-on chapters: setup, concepts, bytecode/execution, tooling, examples, advanced topics, and resources.

## Next steps

Continue to Chapter 2: Setup and prerequisites (`mcp-02-setup.md`).
